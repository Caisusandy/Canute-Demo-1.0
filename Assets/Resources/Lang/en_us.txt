Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.0=It is funny that where the name of "Avgium" can from, so the scientist name it after Aether’s step father, which was the dragon king Avgas.
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.1=Since aethium means "light" and it has the same origin as the king Aether Erinope, and the Avgium was discovered in a huge mine of aethium.
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.2=Hmm… My sister? I haven’t met her for five years; she is a grown up already. I mean, all Pullans are strong and independent, she will be fine. But anyway, can I have a vacation, just to see how is she doing?
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.3=Chairman Canute, even though you are part of the Project Ankaa, I don’t really know much about you before. 
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.4=Ankaa? The firebird on the sky that can reborn, they name is project as they want Anexar also reborn.
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.5=Wow, Finn won the tennis competition yesterday. I am totally not interested in this competition.
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.6=If… How can Aethium and Avgium have so much reaction to magnetic fields? This is it! I am done with this stupid stone. No, I am just kidding, Mr. Chairman.
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.7=Nah, I don’t know why we are so focused on Magnetics for thousands of years, we can’t change the history of that after all, or can we?
Canute.Character.Theodore Pullan.WordLine.8=How many times I have told you, I am not a calculator, Finn! Ok, what? The answer is 42, yes, 42, still, yes all answers are 42.

Canute.Character.Finn Herman.WordLine.3=Last time I saw Theodore on a vacation, he was playing tennis.
Canute.Character.Finn Herman.WordLine.4=Sir, do you like Calay more or here? Oh, I think you like Sigma Quadrant more because that was your home.
Canute.Character.Finn Herman.WordLine.5=Sir, can you tell me more about your experience when you are studying abroad? Where? Of course I am talking about Meialia
Canute.Character.Finn Herman.WordLine.6=Sir, can you tell someone who is going outside to get a simple calculator for me? What? You mean I can just use the Material printers to print one? Yeah!

Canute.Character.Shelly McMoore.WordLine.6=I have actually never been to Calay before, Chairman, I know you were the Senator of Calay, before the Supreme Council took over everything in the Federacy.
Canute.Character.Shelly McMoore.WordLine.7=They said that the last president of the Federacy, Brittany Whitaker, ended the civil war of the Federacy by negotiating with the Supreme Council. Do you think the war is ended?
