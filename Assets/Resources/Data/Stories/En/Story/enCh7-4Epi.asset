        made their way into the city. Canute took a quick count and was relieved
        to see that they\u2019d all survived. Once they\u2019d found their quarters
        for the night, Ron took Canute aside. Quite honestly, Canute was expected
        to be severely chastised for the way he\u2019d handled the battle earlier.

        mostly unnoticed motel. They had very basic layouts, enabling someone to
        see everyone in the room from the kitchen. From his point of view, Canute
        saw a defeated group of people. Most were leaned up against the wall or strewn
        out across the couch. Dark circles under eyes and worn expressions were common.
