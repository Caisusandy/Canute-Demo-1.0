        its size, the town was bustling with people, including Meialian patrols.
        The team managed to coax their vehicles through the traffic until they reached
        a tangled slum on the opposite edge of town. Ron led the group up to a towering
        apartment complex and waited for them to get their vehicles taken care of
        before he headed up the stairs.

        a quick glance around the room as he entered. There were plants everywhere,
        suspended from the ceiling, drooping off of tables, and sitting in old terracotta
        pots on the immaculate kitchen counter. In a flash, Evie had whipped up a
        hearty stew for everyone and set coffee to brew while they ate. She sat on
        the arm of an old armchair with a mug of hot tea and watched them with a
        vague air of disgust. Canute finished first and set aside the bowl.
