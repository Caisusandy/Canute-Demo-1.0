  input: "===\r\nThe next morning, they headed out early to get the most out of the
    day. As they rode, Canute couldn\u2019t help but feel as though something was
    a bit off. Ever since they\u2019d escaped from the prison, there hadn\u2019t
    been too many people searching for them. That was odd considering the disturbance
    they\u2019d made breaking out. There had to be something else going on. He sped
    up until he was even with Ron and contacted him by radio.\r\nRon Thompson\r\nWhat\u2019s
    on your mind, General?\r\n===\r\nRon\u2019s voice came through before Canute
    could pull his words together.\r\nRon Thompson \r\nDon\u2019t act surprised.
    You\u2019ve been puzzling over something the whole ride.\r\nCanute Svesson\r\nDon\u2019t
    you think something\u2019s not right? We only escaped from Swisha Main City\u2019s
    prison and there hasn\u2019t been anyone searching for us.\r\nRon Thompson\r\nWe
    vanished so thoroughly they gave up.\r\n===\r\nRon laughed, then turned serious.\r\nRon
    Thompson \r\nI\u2019ve been thinking about that, too. Do you have a plan?\r\nCanute
    Svesson\r\nI was thinking we could change course and go to the decoy base instead.
    If we radio ahead, they could have reinforcements waiting for us, just in case.\r\nRon
    Thompson \r\nExcellent idea.\r\n===\r\nRon drove up to the front of the party
    to speak with some of the other leaders. Meanwhile, Canute stayed where he was.
    He needed to make a few calls. \r\n===\r\nThe sun was beginning to set as they
    crested a hill. Their fake base lay before them. In every detail, it resembled
    their real base, but there were a few small differences that only someone on
    their side would notice. The plain was clear, but as they drove closer, Canute
    could make out a figure standing between them and the base. I should\u2019ve
    known. \r\n===\r\nHe signaled, and the group pulled to a stop. He dismounted
    and walked forward alone. Even though he were wearing a long sleeved black coat,
    the exposed skin of the man standing across from Canute glowed silver in the
    dying sun. His calculating blue eyes observed every detail, taking in Canute\u2019s
    worn clothing and making him feel small and insignificant. Canute straightened
    up and looked the man, no, the robot in the eyes.\r\nCanute Svensson\r\nAnexar.
    What a pleasant surprise.\r\n===\r\nAnexar\u2019s laugh grated across the ears
    of everyone who heard it.\r\nAnexar Flotics\r\nThe pleasure is mine. I will enjoy
    destroying you and your pathetic little allies.\r\n===\r\nFrom behind them all,
    Canute could hear the whirr of approaching helicopters and the marching feet
    of soldiers. He closed his eyes tight for a moment and prayed his call had gone
    through. Without warning, something darkened the sun. He opened his eyes and
    almost laughed in delight. Something long and thin was winging its way toward
    them across the empty plains. It pulled to a stop just above the base, lit from
    behind by the setting sun that illuminated its every scale. \r\nCanute Svensson\r\nAmlos!\r\n===\r\nCanute
    noticed something, a dragon is coming from the sky, and he shouted to it. \r\nCanute
    Svensson\r\nGlad you could make it.\r\n===\r\nThe dragon roared in response.
    The sound rolled across the plain and struck fear into the hearts of everyone
    who heard it.\r\nAnexar Flotics\r\nThe time has come for me to collect my revenge.\r\n===\r\nHe
    shot forward towards the helicopters, fire blazing out of his mouth. Anexar took
    all of this in with a calculating gaze, shaking his head. \r\nAnexar Flotics\r\nYou
    will regret this day, Canute.\r\n===\r\nA helicopter flew overhead and let down
    its beam to pick Anexar up. Canute rushed back to his team, ready for whatever
    could happen. \r\nCanute Svensson\r\nThis is not about us. This is about the
    future. This is about Arthur. This is about all of the people who need us to
    take a stand so they can have a better life. This is dangerous, and we may die,
    but this is worth it. \r\n===\r\nThe two armies crashed together like an earthquake.\r\n"
