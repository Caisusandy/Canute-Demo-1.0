  input: "===\r\nThey broke through the last scraps of the prison's defenses and
    the night air had never felt so good on Canute\u2019s face. Evelyn lead the charge
    back to their safe place. Everyone was glowing, victory shining through their
    faces even though they hadn\u2019t accomplished what they\u2019d originally intended.\r\n===\r\nCanute
    burst through the hotel door to a defeated scene. The tech team were strewn across
    the couch, empty coffee cups around them. They awoke with a start at the sudden
    noise, then grumbled when they saw Canute,\r\nFinn Herman\r\nYou\u2019ve got
    to be joking, sir. With all due respect, you gave us quite the scare.\r\nCanute
    Svensson\r\nBut we\u2019re back, aren\u2019t we? And we\u2019ve got information
    we didn\u2019t have before! We can still rescue Arthur.\r\n===\r\nEvelyn perched
    on the counter and rolled her eyes.\r\nEvelyn Burke\r\nWe\u2019re all going to
    need rescuing if we don\u2019t get out of here. Those prison wardens aren\u2019t
    going to let us keep wandering the city for long.\u201D\r\n===\r\nRon nodded.\r\nRon
    Thompson\r\nEvelyn\u2019s right. Heading back to base is the safest thing for
    now. Everyone was in agreement, and they headed out of the city as soon as possible.
