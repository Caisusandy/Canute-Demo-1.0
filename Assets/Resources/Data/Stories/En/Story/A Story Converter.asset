  input: "===\r\nThe next morning, a humbled group of men and women took down their
    tents and carried on. Canute was able to breathe a little easier when they left
    the scrappy little town behind them. As they travelled, the line was quiet. Even
    Finn had nothing to say, and for once, Canute would have welcomed the sound of
    his chatter. \r\n===\r\nAnything to take his mind off of the stifling shroud
    of guilt covering it. Looking back on what had happened the night before, there
    wasn\u2019t anything he could\u2019ve done to prevent it, but somehow, his head
    persuaded him into thinking all of it was his fault. He clenched his hands into
    fists for a moment then rubbed them off on his pants in an attempt to rid them
    of the invisible blood.\r\n===\r\nHe wished that Arthur could be there to help
    him. His teacher had always known what to say when Canute came back from another
    lesson with a bloody nose or black eye. He had been one of the smallest students,
    but somehow he managed to get into fights. You don\u2019t know when to quit,
    Arthur would say. \r\n===\r\nCanute shook his head at his younger self and laughed.
    Look where that got me. The rest of the afternoon passed in silence, and as the
    sun was beginning to set, they could see what looked like a fallen star in the
    distance. Canute shielded his eyes from the sun\u2019s glare in order to get
    a better look at the strange vision. As he squinted, the rays of light coming
    from the star resolved themselves into buildings that sprawled out across the
    empty plains for miles. \r\n===\r\nThe city resembled all of the others they\u2019d
    been through so far, except their separate details had been combined into one
    cosmopolitan mess. The outside was a bristling thicket of crumbling buildings
    and smog, occasionally rocked by random explosions, while the inner circle was
    polished, sleek, and looked rather expensive.\r\n===\r\nCanute felt like he was
    seeing all of their world\u2019s problems summed up in one city. Those in power
    taxed the poor to afford their own petty luxuries, leading to vast disparities
    in quality of life. The idea made his stomach twist and gave him new resolve.
    This rescue is just the first step, he thought. Once we rescue Arthur, we can
    do so much more. We can change the way these people are living. \r\n===\r\nHis
    courage strengthened, he lead his team closer to the city. They were a few hundred
    yards within reach of the outskirts when Finn stopped walking. Canute turned
    around to reprimand him, but stopped when he noticed the look on his younger
    friend\u2019s face.\r\nRon Thompson\r\nDo you hear that?\r\n===\r\nFinn\u2019s
    face paled as he spoke, glancing at the sky above them. Canute listened and realized
    Finn was right. He could hear the whirr of helicopter blades approaching, and
    it didn\u2019t take long for his questions to be answered. Out of the tall spires
    of the wealthy side of Swisha Main City came three hovercraft.\r\n===\r\nAs they
    approached, he could make out the symbol of the Supreme Council on their sides.
    They cleared the edge of the city and stopped, forming a dark line. Transport
    beams shot out of their bellies in glowing columns. It was too far away to make
    out details, but soldiers descended the hovercrafts and assembled on the plains
    across from the team. Having deposited their cargo, the helicopters retracted
    their transport beams and returned the way they had come.\r\n===\r\nCanute watched
    them go and joined Ron in giving orders to his meager forces. The other soldiers
    started forward in stiff uniform squads. Gradually, Canute could make out the
    details of their faces and felt a chill slip into the pit of his stomach. These
    were no ordinary soldiers. Their eyes glowed neon green and held no mercy, and
    under their armor, harsh black metal gleamed. \r\n===\r\nThese were the prize
    warrior robots of the Swisha, equipped with artificial intelligence and superior
    weaponry. Time seemed to slow down. There was no sound except for the mechanical
    whir of the approaching troops and the wind in Canute\u2019s ears. He looked
    at the group around him and his heart swelled with pride. If this was how his
    life ended, he would be proud to fight alongside companions like these. \r\n"
