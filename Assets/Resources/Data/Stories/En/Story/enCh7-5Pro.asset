      line: "The next morning after a quick breakfast, the team laid out their plans
        on the tiny kitchen table. Once the scouts had returned, their meeting began.
        During the quiet parts of the journey, Canute had been able to think over
        how they were going to rescue his teacher, and his plan had been almost complete
        until he was shown the scans the scouts had taken of the prison. The security
        systems were fairly advanced, but that wasn\u2019t anything they couldn\u2019t
        handle. \n"

        to match the prison. The team would don prison guard uniforms and come in
        for the next shift. Ron used yet another one of his many contacts and found
        an inside man who could get them Arthur\u2019s cell number and a map of the
        prison. It was a crazy idea, but it could work. \n"

        Before he could get a grasp on time, it slipped out of his hands and another
        day had gone by.

        You\u2019ve gotten this far. Live a little. So he ate his greasy takeout

        Arthur. The others would stay at the motel and keep in touch, ready to flee
        at a moment\u2019s notice if anything went wrong. Once everyone was ready,
        Canute turned around from his place at the front of the line, trying to muster
        anything resembling a motivational speech. His words were halting and far
        from eloquent, but he spoke them with all of this heart.\n"
