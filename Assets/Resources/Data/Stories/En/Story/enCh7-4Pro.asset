        and carried on. Canute was able to breathe a little easier when they left
        the scrappy little town behind them. As they travelled, the line was quiet.
        Even Finn had nothing to say, and for once, Canute would have welcomed the
        sound of his chatter. \n"

        anything he could\u2019ve done to prevent it, but somehow, his head persuaded
        him into thinking all of it was his fault. He clenched his hands into fists
        for a moment then rubbed them off on his pants in an attempt to rid them
        of the invisible blood.\n"

        nose or black eye. He had been one of the smallest students, but somehow
        he managed to get into fights. You don\u2019t know when to quit, Arthur would

        got me. The rest of the afternoon passed in silence, and as the sun was beginning
        to set, they could see what looked like a fallen star in the distance. Canute
        shielded his eyes from the sun\u2019s glare in order to get a better look
        at the strange vision. As he squinted, the rays of light coming from the
        star resolved themselves into buildings that sprawled out across the empty
        plains for miles. \n"

        except their separate details had been combined into one cosmopolitan mess.
        The outside was a bristling thicket of crumbling buildings and smog, occasionally
        rocked by random explosions, while the inner circle was polished, sleek,
        and looked rather expensive.\n"

        up in one city. Those in power taxed the poor to afford their own petty luxuries,
        leading to vast disparities in quality of life. The idea made his stomach
        twist and gave him new resolve. This rescue is just the first step, he thought.
        Once we rescue Arthur, we can do so much more. We can change the way these
        people are living. \n"

        answered. Out of the tall spires of the wealthy side of Swisha Main City

        on their sides. They cleared the edge of the city and stopped, forming a

        It was too far away to make out details, but soldiers descended the hovercrafts
        and assembled on the plains across from the team. Having deposited their
        cargo, the helicopters retracted their transport beams and returned the way
        they had come.

        the pit of his stomach. These were no ordinary soldiers. Their eyes glowed
        neon green and held no mercy, and under their armor, harsh black metal gleamed.
