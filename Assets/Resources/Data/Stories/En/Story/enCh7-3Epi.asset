        of tired soldiers came out. Most sported bruises and cuts, while others were
        worse off and had to be supported by their comrades. Canute held Ron up under
        his shoulder despite the older man\u2019s protests. \n"

        set up camp in the barren land around it. Canute found the spirit to admire
        the sunset even though they\u2019d barely made it out of that room with their
        lives. Behind him, sounds of pain came from the medic tent and it made him
        wince. He was a general, yes, but he had feelings even if they were deeply
        buried. He hated to see his companions like this. \n"

        When he saw Canute, he made his way slowly over. Every step looked like it
        was costing him all of his energy to keep from falling. Canute stood to help
        him, but Ron raised a hand and lowered himself to the ground without help.
        The two men sat in silence for a while before Ron came out of his stewing
        thoughts. \n"
