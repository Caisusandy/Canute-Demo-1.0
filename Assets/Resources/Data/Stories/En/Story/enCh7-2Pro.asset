        wound. He was pleased to hear that he\u2019d survive the night and quickly
        fell asleep from exhaustion after his bandages were changed. One by one,
        the team members settled down across the room, using their packs or each
        other as pillows. \n"

        couldn\u2019t have been a stonier silence than there was between Evelyn and
        Ron. Canute tried to break the silence, but he felt like he was only making
        it worse, so he simply sat there and nursed his coffee, enjoying the warmth
        on his icy fingers. Evelyn eventually spoke up, her voice a little softer
        and less stressed than it was before. It sounded like she was trying to make
        an attempt to bury the hatchet. \n"
