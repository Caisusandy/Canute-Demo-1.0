        seemed to be floating there, pale as ghosts. Some looked afraid, while others
        rested a quiet hand on their weapon of choice, stern and ready. He kept watch
        through the night, but things still hadn\u2019t calmed down. \n"

        friend. Some of the boyishness left his face and was replaced by stubble
        and a grim expression that floated between his eyebrows and vanished when
        he smiled. This was no longer a fun adventure, a new experience. The life
        of a real human being was in the balance, and they were depending on Canute
        and his team to save them even if they didn\u2019t know the team was coming.
