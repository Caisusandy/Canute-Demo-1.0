      line: "Their companions in street clothes had stayed to fight the droids and
        pretended to be riotous citizens while the others continued on, saying they\u2019d
        return with \u201Cbackup.\u201D A thread of guilt grew in Canute\u2019s stomach,
        but he acknowledged it and shoved it down. The people they\u2019d left behind
        were more than capable of handling those chunks of metal. They\u2019d already
        proved their strength in the battle outside Swisha Main City. \n"

        out of his mind. After the scuffle with the droids, they hurried to reach
        Arthur\u2019s cell in time before someone had a chance to raise the alarm.
        Canute had to contain his nervous energy as their lockpicker worked on the
        door. It slid open with a hiss, and lights turned on automatically.\n"

      line: "Two bunks stuck out from the opposite wall. The pillow on the bottom
        bunk had been used recently, and the blanket was wrinkled, as if someone
        had kicked it aside when they\u2019d woken up that morning. Other than that,
        the cell was empty. Canute rushed in, looking around for any signs of a struggle,
        but there were none. Before he could react, more security droids had swarmed
        out of nowhere.\n"

        door with a roar, but it shut in his face, leaving him there pounding on
