        As they rode, Canute couldn\u2019t help but feel as though something was
        a bit off. Ever since they\u2019d escaped from the prison, there hadn\u2019t
        been too many people searching for them. That was odd considering the disturbance
        they\u2019d made breaking out. There had to be something else going on. He
        sped up until he was even with Ron and contacted him by radio.\n"

        to a stop just above the base, lit from behind by the setting sun that illuminated
        its every scale. \n"
