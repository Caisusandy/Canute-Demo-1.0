        visited before. Canute thought they\u2019d descended into some dark mixture
        of their land and the dark place underneath it. There was a constant choking
        smoke in the air and eerie noises echoed in the narrow streets. \n"

        eyes darted side to side, and his hand was in his pocket fidgeting with something.
        Canute looked around at everyone else, noting similar reactions to the atmosphere,
        and took a calming breath. He regretted it as the stench of the town clung
        to his nostrils, and coughed. \n"

        on a crumbling rusty fire escape. This time, there were almost no working
        lights in the hallways. Music thumped behind some of the closed doors as
        they walked single file to the end of the hallway. \n"

        on the outside of the door before letting the seemingly normal peephole scan
        his eye. A chorus of mechanical noises ensued and he let them in, closing
        the door quickly behind them. The inside wasn\u2019t much better than the
        hallway, but the scraggly group sitting at the table under the singular ceiling
        light was much worse.\n"
