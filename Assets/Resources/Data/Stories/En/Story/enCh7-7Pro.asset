      line: "There was a clock on the wall, but Canute could have forgotten what
        day it was and it wouldn't have mattered. His spirit had crumbled when that
        door slammed. All of the hardship in the world couldn\u2019t cure him of
        his idealistic streak, and now he was paying for it. Eventually he lost track
        of how long he stared at that door, ingraining every detail into his mind
        until he went numb.\n"

        found himself slumped against the bottom bunk. He picked himself up and straightened
        his uniform. Even though he didn\u2019t want to admit it, his mind was significantly
        clearer. The more he thought, the more he realized how foolish he had been
        to throw himself a pity party like this. \n"

        he certainly wouldn\u2019t have made it to this point in time. Maybe it would
        have been better if I wasn\u2019t here. Canute stopped that idea right where
        it stood, standing up and pacing back and forth. He remembered the speech
        he had given the rest of the team the morning of their first breakout attempt.
        You are all here for a reason. \n"

        if his change of heart had summoned the opportunity, his cell door hissed
        open. Canute looked up, uncertain. For a moment, the bright rectangle of
        light was empty, then a figure stepped into it. They were rather short, and
        it took a moment for Canute\u2019s eyes to adjust. Then he noticed the red
        hair.\n"
