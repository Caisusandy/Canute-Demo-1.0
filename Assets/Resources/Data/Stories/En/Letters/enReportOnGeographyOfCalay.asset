    title: Report on Geography of Calay
    background: {fileID: 0}
    text: 'Since the first year humans lived in Fantarium, the Sigma Space City has
      landed on the refuge plateau of the Eastern Continent and has established the
      Great Enchantment on which we live today to block the dry ice storm and low
      temperature that rages outside.



      The Second Human Self-Government ambitiously
      launched an incentive plan with the theme of exploration and development and
      is committed to quickly recovering to the pre-war industrial and people''s
      livelihood. The two most prosperous cities in our revival era, Calay and Anexar,
      are the direct product of this plan. This report will briefly introduce the
      development record of Kalai and the introduction of the surrounding geographical
      structure.



      Kalane Sherimithe was born in the underground city of Uto
      at the unknown time during the Third Pan-Continent War, later graduated from
      the University of Uto with a Ph.D. in business, took over the family industry
      3 years later, the Uto Mantle Minerals, at the end of the war,  and being a
      mining experts boarded Sigma Space City.



      On July 3rd, Kalane, as most
      of the entrepreneurs who responded to the government''s incentive plan, brought
      a pioneering group of about 300 people to the A9 Plain, north of the Black
      Mountains Range. A9 Plain has a large number of high-quality forests among
      the towering cliffs. And lakes. Subsequent exploration confirmed that there
      are abundant artificial aethium materials and complex underground rivers in
      this area. Immediately, Kalane established its own basic colony near a lake
      in the west of this plateau oasis, and 10 years later, it will be The mineral
      processing center of Kalane Mining. In order to expand the scale of production
      and the company, Kalane Mining cooperated with Goblin Construction to build
      a small town for the convenience of the miners. Kalin is the third Pan-Land
      War in Kalin The lost brother, Kalin named the town Calay to commemorate the
      tragic ending of the Third Pan-Continent War and her relatives. Calay is located
      in the gap in the mountain gorge north of the plateau oasis. This is just a
      resident mining town with a population of 10,000 at this time. Today, the small
      town of Calay is still the last stop of the train to Swisha.



      Thirty
      years later, KalaneMining has grown into a huge commercial group that spans
      mining, medical, and transportation through acquisitions, mergers, and other
      means, Kalin Group. When Kalane Group was preparing to further develop Kalin
      into When it belonged to its own new high-tech park, the Second Human Autonomous
      Government entered into a fierce battle over whether to get rid of Saint Vasolina
      and become an independent state. At this time, the political situation was
      turbulent, and the entire society was plunged into the shadow of war. San Vasolina
      has also entered a state of emergency war mobilization. The two sides are at
      a cold war. The cold war lasted for a whole century. A whole generation of
      people fell into a stagnant development in this cold war, and when there was
      a century of arms race between the two sides. When the endeavor is finally
      coming to an end, the new high-tech park in Calay has been forced to transform
      into a heavy industrial production center under the pressure of the government.
      And a large backlog of weapons that are nowhere to be used can only be hoarded
      in the abandoned mines below Calay, the Kalane Group was also hit hard during
      the post-Cold War transformation. After the Black Mountains railway to Swaziwa
      was closed after the restored Second Human Federation, Calay seemed to be caught
      in the economic cold winter. According to the data we can recover from the
      old paper materials, during the heavy industry period, Kalai had a permanent
      population of more than 300,000, but the per capita income was only 5,822 Meials,
      which is equivalent to the 1219 fedgram.



      In the year 577 in Fantarium,
      the Karane Group finally restored the previous level, and together with the
      Goblin Construction, Versatile Heavy Industry, and the Prophet Virtual invested
      in the heavy industry in Kalai and optimized the urban structure of Kalai,
      and turned it into a new type comparable to Sigma In the city, this plan was
      not completed until 1100 FF. The advanced mining system, which is two kilometers
      underground, and the underground sewage system that extends for thousands of
      meters, has completely intersected with the underground rivers previously surveyed.
      Buildings over 500 meters above the surface It is everywhere. According to
      the 1331 census of Fantarium, the resident population of Kalai is as high as
      10 million, about 15% of the total population of the entire Federation, and
      the per capita income is 28,077 Fedgrams.



      Kalane Mining Processing
      Center borders Calay City, the difference is no more than 500 meters, but the
      scale of the two parties is no longer comparable. After nearly 800 years of
      development, Calay has become the benchmark of the new era city in the 14th
      century. , The Calay Rail Station, located in the northeastern part of the
      city, has become an important connection point between the Federation of Mankind
      and Swaziland. The old town located in the gap of the mountain gorge was refurbished
      by Leprechaun Construction into a new generation of high-tech parks, while
      some buildings close to the city center were kept.
