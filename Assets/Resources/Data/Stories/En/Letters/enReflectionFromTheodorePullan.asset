    text: "When I visited the Federal Academy of Human Sciences for the first time,
      it was actually empty. The new building was built after the Civil War. I told
      other colleagues that this was fine, and the government gave us a big whiteboard.
      Fortunately, at least the previous scientific data are still there. I have
      all the experimental data I want.\r\nI have been joking with my colleagues
      about one thing: \"Do you know why the Meialian can\u2019t understand the existence
      of friction? Because they rely on dragons for fire.\" Of course, I wouldn't
      tell this joke when the Meialians are by my side. Besides, their previous technological
      level is not bad.\r\nI still remember that when I was young, I opened a cabinet
      at home. It was full of antiques from a thousand years ago. In particular,
      there was a ticket for entering the Sigma Quadrant. I was quite shocked at
      the time. I checked all the books related to the Sigma Quadrant and found out
      that the Sigma Quadrant was a giant space city that was launched magnetically.
      This shocked me. How do we drive such a heavy thing into the sky with a magnetic
      field?\r\nThen I learned later that our ancestors discovered magnetism as early
      as ten thousand years ago. They knew the relationship between electricity and
      magnetism eight thousand years ago. Three thousand years ago, they built a
      spacecraft that could be lifted off by a giant magnetic levitation method.
      The reason why we can create the Sigma Quadrant two thousand years ago is that
      we have never tried to stop moving forward.\r\nWhen the Supreme Council repaired
      the central AI in the Sigma Quadrant for me, I was also thinking about why
      we didn\u2019t get more AI to work for us. After I looked through the compilation
      records of this AI, I found that the old AI is a bit different. Believe it,
      he compiled it long before the Sigma Quadrant was built. Our ancestors of two
      thousand years have known how to create artificial intelligence. In fact, three
      thousand years ago, they built the machines that can pass the Turing test.\r\nI
      have no idea what I just said. After all, our generation is doing what we are
      doing and what we want to do, studying what I want to study, we are free from
      any threat on this continent.\r\nBut looking around us, there is nothing here
      that is not created by our ancestors. Everything we study is actually research
      on top of our ancestors. Our ancestors took the first step of research, and
      then the offspring of our ancestors took the second step, and then the offspring
      of our ancestors\u2019 offspring took the third step, and we just stepped into
      the future we were after.\r\nWe humans don't know magic, and I don't care about
      that. The important thing is that we have the technology. Science can guide
      us humanity forward. Those of us are finding the end of science that does not
      exist. We are here to explore boundless science.\r\n"
