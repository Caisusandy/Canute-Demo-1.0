    text: "The \"fairy\" parasite, the scientific name OP (Olfactory Parasite)-\u03B2
      is a deadly burrowing parasite that has existed before the signing of the Second
      Pan-Land War Peace Treaty. They are mainly distributed in the underground caves
      of the West Continent, And paleontologists believe that this creature has existed
      for at least 10,000 years. With the great mobilization before the Flood, many
      human refugees have arrived in the Eastern Continent with these parasitic worms,
      spreading these parasitic worms In the entire Great Enchantment. According
      to the annual statistical report of the Epidemiology Branch of the Academy
      of Human Sciences in 1021, the deaths of OP-\u03B2 accounted for 53.92% of
      all human deaths from parasites each year. Due to the unique symptoms of OP-\u03B2,
      OP -\u03B2 is basically unable to be cured by normal methods in the final host
      stage, but OP- \u03B2 has very strict environmental requirements at the larval
      stage, so all cities in the Human Federation have a complete OP- \u03B2 epidemic
      prevention system.\r\nOP-\u03B2 is mutated from OE (Olfactory Ectoparasite)-\u03B1.
      OE-\u03B1 is a parasitic worm that hosts burrowing cold-blooded creatures with
      a length of 30 microns. OE-\u03B1 is mainly distributed near pyroxene veins.
      The specific reason is that Pyroxene is one of the essential nutrients for
      the reproduction of OE-\u03B1. It is pyroxene that has nurtured the colorful
      creatures on the Western Continent. Some biologists even suspect that humans
      and dragons, such as intelligent creatures, are also affected by pyroxene.
      In order to develop civilization (<Dragon, Human, Pyroxene> by Antonio Rand).
      In the larval egg stage, OE-\u03B1 will stay in place until the larva has absorbed
      enough pyroxene radiation to grow into OE- \u03B11, at which time OE -\u03B11
      will extend a pair of appendages on both sides of the limbs. This pair of appendages
      give OE- \u03B11 the ability to float briefly in the cave. In the cave environment
      where the air is almost difficult to circulate, OE- \u03B11 can be relaxed
      and not affected. Interferingly adsorbs inside the host's respiratory tract.
      However, OE-\u03B11 alone can hardly affect any creatures underground, so OE-\u03B11
      will release pheromone after adsorbing to the host's respiratory tract, attracting
      surrounding OE-\u03B11 to parasitize.\r\n If a large amount of OE-\u03B11 successfully
      roots in the host's respiratory tract, in fact, even if it fails to parasitize,
      as long as any OE-\u03B11 larva survives in the host's respiratory tract, they
      will gather together to form OE-\u03B12, surrounding OE-\u03B11 Gather together
      and secrete a layer of membrane to wrap up all the OE-\u03B11 inside, and inside
      the membrane, OE-\u03B11 will degrade and reassemble your body into the next
      stage of the organism, OE-\u03B12. It will last from 1 week to 2 weeks. This
      layer of membrane can easily be mistaken for a pustule in the respiratory tract.
      After OE-\u03B12 breaks the pupae (OE-\u03B12 has a long and slender body shape
      but has a very critical point in the middle of the body OE-\u03B12 will use
      its own unique microbial structure to emit pyroxene radiation to the surrounding
      cell tissues and carry out a targeted gene mutation called pyroxene dependence.
      The specific characteristics are The host can \"sniff\" the pyroxene veins
      within one kilometer and is very eager to contact pyroxene. This is because
      OE-\u03B12 stimulates a desire to return to the host, which is very obvious
      in the burrowing creature burrow mole, but there is no return. Habitual creatures
      think that there is food in that direction. Pyroxene dependence is actually
      the reproductive behavior of OE-\u03B11. When the host reaches the pyroxene
      vein, OE-\u03B12 will lay eggs and throw them out of the respiratory tract
      or stay in the host. While stimulating pyroxene dependence, a large amount
      of pyroxene radiation will cause the host's respiratory tract to grow a large
      number of pyroxene crystals ranging from 1cm to 10cm. These stones will cause
      great harm to the host, and the specific harm will not be here. To repeat.
      Then OE-\u03B12 will live on the pyroxene crystals produced by pyroxene radiation,
      and repeat this reproductive behavior until the host dies or the pyroxene is
      exhausted.\r\nTherefore, the life of OE- \u03B1 is divided into three stages:
      eggs, larvae OE- \u03B11, and adults OE- \u03B12. These three stages of OE-
      \u03B1 feed on the parasitic cave mole in the underground caves of the West
      Continent, at least in the Pan-Continent countries. This was the case before
      the development of pyroxene.\r\nAfter the Second Pan-Continent War, due to
      the monopolization of excellent magicians and cutting-edge magic technology
      by Miella, the First Human Autonomous Government issued a number of applications
      for the rapid development of pyroxene application technology and magic theories,
      which were considered by later generations. It is a policy to encourage pyroxene,
      including a policy to purchase pyroxene at a high price. Although this policy
      has stimulated the development of the pyroxene market, the equipment and knowledge
      required to mine pyroxene are scarce by some speculators. Most of the hui Stone
      veins are excavated by miners who are low in productivity and do not understand
      any common sense of hygiene. Naturally, most of these miners are infected with
      OE-\u03B1, but OE-\u03B1 is only an intermediate host in the human respiratory
      tract, OE -\u03B1 will only be adsorbed in the respiratory tract for a period
      of time, and then it will detach. If OE- \u03B1 tries to enter the adult state,
      OE- \u03B1 will be cleaned up by the body's immune system. However, there are
      some miners with poor immunity in some An unknown time was used as a savings
      host by OE-\u03B1 and these miners were regarded as a miracle because of their
      ability to perceive pyroxene veins, so their pyroxene dependence and pyroxene
      hobby were regarded as a sacrifice, Speculators think this disease, no, at
      the time it was not even regarded as a disease, but a kind of progress and
      this kind of progress is good for their income. (<Analysis of historical data-first
      The History of Magical Theory of Human Self-Government> by Serena Arthur) These
      infected miners are called shining angels, not only because they can quickly
      find mineral veins, but also because their stones are shining in the sunlight
      and kerosene lamps. It is bright and named. As the condition of these miners
      became more and more serious, OE-\u03B1 slowly developed a phenomenon of continuous
      human-to-human transmission, infecting miners throughout the mining area. When
      people in an entire mining area were trying to gnaw pyroxene At the time, the
      image of the shining angels also collapsed, but when the prosecutors of the
      First Human Autonomous Government entered the mining area to try to investigate,
      they found that some of the shining angels could use magic to resist the soldiers
      who tried to burn them. OE-\u03B1 The second effect was revealed, enhancing
      the magician\u2019s pyroxene affinity. The pyroxene calculus produced by pyroxene
      dependence allows the host to use magic better. Due to the poor scientific
      theory and the first human autonomous government, The foundation is simply
      not enough to support such in-depth biological and magical framework research,
      so even if the progress brought by this parasite is very tempting, they have
      not succeeded in discovering how to use these aethium radiations or Harmless
      aethium dependence.\r\nUntil the human autonomy treaty was signed, a large
      number of dungeons joined together to form the first human federation. At that
      time, people remembered the great potential of OE-\u03B1, and slowly revealed
      the tip of pyroxene genetics. The principles unearthed from OE-\u03B1 are applied
      to urban agriculture, and the agricultural defects of underground cities are
      also filled by the strange element of pyroxene. The prosperity brought about
      by agricultural progress is well known. In the middle part of federal history,
      people who yearn for progress tried to harmlessize aethium dependence and regain
      the challenges of the old age. Even though several years of research, people
      have developed a method to increase the addiction rate with a slightly lower
      addiction rate, which has benefited a lot of benefits. A magician post, but
      pyroxene dependence has not been eradicated.\r\n\r\nA very strange mental illness
      suddenly appeared in the First Human Federation at some time. It is said that
      the patients have a solid foundation in magic, and they claim that they have
      seen goblins, and their magic skills have also improved. The patients are the
      same. In addition to communicating with the sick, they will not communicate
      with any humans but will take care of some wild animals suffering from primitive
      dependence. A few months later, the patients spontaneously gathered in the
      underground city \"Jita\" and declared independence and control The entire
      dungeon government. Due to the closed nature of the dungeon, the guitar soon
      fell. When the federal government intervened, the whole city was a follower
      of goblins. The disease was later discovered to be caused by the OE-\u03B1
      mutation. , Became what is now known as OP-\u03B2. Because patients are obsessed
      with \"fairies\", they are known as fairy parasites.\r\nOP-\u03B2 is after
      OE-\u03B1 is mutated, OE-\u03B1 1 enters the brain of the host along the blood
      vessels and develops into adult worms in the brain. After developing into adults,
      it affects the thalamus of the brain, so that the host can understand that
      only OE-\u03B1 originally After analyzing the pheromone, the host will have
      hallucinations, thinking that he has seen the goblins and knows where they
      are. From this step, OP-\u03B2 separates OP-\u03B2 and becomes a new parasitic
      worm, and OP-\u03B2 also Qiu Jue, who will gradually replace the host, becomes
      the new owner of this body. OP-\u03B2, like its predecessor, can improve the
      host\u2019s magic skills, so everyone parasitized by OP-\u03B2 will be taken
      by OP-\u03B2 Replacement and must be a powerful magician. The First Human Federation
      made a huge sacrifice when trying to clear the Jita dungeon because they thought
      there was a survivor in the city. At this time, the President of the Federation
      realized the weaponization of these creatures. Potential, but later studies
      have shown that they are completely ineffective against dragons because the
      control of magic in the dragon body makes it impossible for fairies to use
      magic to influence them. But these deadly creatures are a huge threat to humans
      because they are the first generation of The host is humans. Fortunately, OP-\u03B2
      has stricter requirements for the environment. In the year of the outbreak,
      the underground city immediately upgraded the sewer filtration and microbial
      monitoring at the time, but the continued spread of human-to-human transmission
      It still exists. With the unremitting efforts of the government, before the
      start of the third Pan-Land War, the parasitism rate of OP-\u03B2 was not high,
      but they knew how to parasitize some wild underground organisms, which made
      OP-\u03B2 more difficult to eradicate.\r\nWhen the Sigma Quadrant landed on
      the plateau of the Eastern Continent, the organisms parasitized by OP-\u03B2
      also spread to the interior of the illusion following the incomplete review
      of the Noah Project, and it still troubles people to this day. \r\n\r\nEra
