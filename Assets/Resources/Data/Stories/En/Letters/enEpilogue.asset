    text: "It is winter again.\r\nIt has been a long time since the Fantarium Weather
      Console has worked seriously about weather management. In the past two years,
      the area around them has not had a few sunny days, most of the time it is shrouded
      in black clouds, and the temperature has constantly hovered near polar temperatures.
      There is only a white snowfield outside, and most vegetation has frozen to
      death. And on this rare sunny day, Canute noticed something. The sky is cloudless
      now.\r\nMaybe this winter is coming to an end.\r\nHe checked the calendar.
      It was March now; maybe spring was finally coming.\r\nIt might be that someone
      finally realized that no one was managing the weather console. Or, in such
      a chaotic age, even if someone noticed it, they couldn't tell everyone. He
      has not paid attention to many outside affairs in two years. Since living in
      seclusion here, management of all contacts with the outside world has been
      handed over to Finn.\r\nHe walked out of the base and found that the temperature
      outside was already higher than it had imagined. At the foot of the mountain
      in the distance, he saw a group of people walking towards the base. Their dresses
      are heavy, as white as snow. Among them, one person took out a red flag and
      held it, while the others were trying to carry something. Canute decided to
      walk towards them.\r\n\"Sir! We are back.\" The man holding the banner was
      also approaching Canute, shouting excitedly in the snow. He trots in the snow,
      holding a flagpole as a cane. The snow was so slippery that he eventually fell
      to the ground, then got up and continued to walk towards Canute.\r\n\"How many
      supplies did you bring back this time?\" Canute didn't pay much attention to
      his excitement.\r\n\"A lot, it could be said that there is too many, the kind
      that is close to infinite!\"\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\"Actually, as usual, three vehicles
      of normal supplies.\" A man walked off the freight car. He was already quite
      old, a his hair color already capable  of blending into the snow. \"Finn means
      that this is a big deal. Let\u2019s go indoors first, it\u2019s too cold out
      here, Canute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe base was built into the mountains. Canute and
      others discovered this forgotten mine shaft a long time ago. After it was modified,
      it became the headquarters of the Scientific Revolutionary Party. The walls
      are made of thick enough stone  mixed with  reinforcement materials. There
      is sufficient heating technology inside, as well as various facilities such
      as greenhouses and research stations. It is hard to imagine the world inside.\r\nWhile
      Canute and the others were walking down the hallway, they saw a person in the
      nearby research room, fiddling  with the same large equipment. He used dozens
      of devices on one side to connect the test together. The magnetic field generator
      had a radius equal to his height. He saw Canute and everyone outside but did
      not say hello. On the contrary, he pressed the unknown remote control in his
      hand, and the machine beside him began to roar. It resounded through the entire
      base, then stopped in an instant like the closing of a chorus.\r\nThe man dropped
      the remote control on the side table and walked out of the laboratory.\r\n\"Welcome
      Ron Thompson. Our famous aethium smuggler has returned to the headquarters
      of the Scientific Revolutionary Party.\" He spoke to the white-headed man,
      a smile slowly spreading across his face.\r\n\"Congratulations, Theodore Pullan,
      the famous privacy peeper, whoseaethium institute completed the chorus performance
      and only sang for two or three seconds.\"\r\n\"These two or three seconds are
      the best progress so far. If I can, I hope I can go outside.\"\r\nEveryone
      looked at the instrument that Theodore had just operated. Behind the magnetic
      field generator, there was a big black box connected to it, which occasionally
      revealed some light. Theodore looked unhappy. He walked to the front and explained
      to everyone, \"As you can see, we can only activate the magnetic field generator
      for about two or three seconds, because I can\u2019t find a component that
      can fit the one from Sigma Quadrant. For this part, I could only remake a new
      one or find one from outside.\"\r\n\"So we can actually make one by ourselves?
      Then why did you let me and Mr. Thompson stroll in the arctic for three months?\"
      Finn rushed to the front of the crowd after hearing Theodore mumble the last
      sentence. \"Do you know that there are almost all Meialians and Swishese out
      there now? What else would you study if we were discovered? Do you plan to
      give them a concert with your choir when they find us?\"\r\n\"It's not impossible,\"
      Theodore didn't particularly pay attention to Finn's anger, but spoke with
      a smile, \"If it was easier to make one myself than to ask you to find one
      outside, I would have done it myself a long time ago. Anyway, did you bring
      back the parts I wanted?\"\r\n\"Go to the logistics department to find it yourself,
      third car.\" Finn glared at Theodore, still very upset. \"The things we brought
      back this time still include a lot of food. I said, can our greenhouse efficiently
      feed us now?\"\r\n\"The progress of the greenhouse is much better than this
      broken generator. If it weren't for it, we would have starved to death at the
      base about two weeks ago. I am rather curious, how did you go out for so long
      this trip?  Do you like the new arctic-like Fantarium?\"\r\n\"That's what I
      want to say,\" Ron inserted into the conversation. \"We tried to come back
      a few weeks ago. But on our way back, we found a group of Meialians camping
      at the intersection here. \"\r\n\"How many people?\" Theodore leaned on one
      hand and pretended that he was concerned about Ron's condition at the time.\r\n\"It's
      impossible to let us come here like blind men. In fact, we could have made
      detours, but who knew that one of our cars would happen to have a malfunction
      We got stuck there until we were caught by those Meialians.\"\r\n\"You were
      discovered by the Meialians.\"\r\n\"That's it. We had to try to use the badge
      that they gave us when we worked with them so they wouldbelieve that we were
      friendly.\"\r\n\"And they believed it?\"\r\n\"Yes. It can only be said that
      there are no dragons in their troops. Anyway, they tried to help us fix the
      vehicle, but while they were trying to accomplish that, we found other things.\"\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\"It's
      not just them, Meialia also sent a lot of troops to Swisha! I accidentally
      fell for their plan!\" Finn snarled. \" Meialia is sending them back. The rest
      of the army goes to Swisha!\"\r\n\"As far as I know, they have not even recovered
      Saint Vasolina,\" Canute voiced his doubts about this plan. \"For them, Saint
      Vasolina is thousand times more important than a slum.\" \r\n\"Yeah.\" Ron
      coughed.\r\n\"Sorry, just an example.\u201D\r\n\"It's okay, anyway, they are
      really moving to Swisha. We left that team as soon as possible, but we discovered
      that there were many teams nearby. They were all the elites of Meialia, dragons,
      and other creatures you have never seen before. We had to find a way around
      them.\"\r\n\"It took you a month?\"\r\n\"They are stationed there and won't
      move. We had to try to wait for them to leave. My original plan was try ot
      get a car through but they seemed very strict.\"\r\n\"Wow, our big smuggler
      can't escape the customs.\" Theodore moved his hand closer to the door of the
      laboratory.\r\n\"We had to go back to Swisha first. Although we still have
      to face other enemies, at least there will be reinforcements. Later, someone
      gave me some news. The Supreme Council is now trying to get through the tunnels
      established by the Septian people, but this time it leads to Swisha.\"\r\n\"They
      have always wanted to build a tunnel to Swisha. This is not a big project.\"\r\n\"If
      they can fix it, they will be able to quickly deploy troops on the west side
      of the Black Mountain Range.\"\r\n\"I guess this is why the Meialians are now
      trying to take Swisha, but the Supreme Council has been able to transport troops
      from near the City of Anexar to the west side of the mountain range for a while
      now.\"\r\n\"Canute, times have changed. The Meialians have already regained
      the City of Aether. Although this has caused them to suffer further losses
      based on a heavier loss.\"\r\n\"This...\" Canute is surprised. He doesn't expect
      Meialia to be able to hold on for so long. In his imagination, maybe Meialia
      has been destroyed, and it might be a few years later that the Supreme Council
      is eliminated.\r\n\"Open the map of Fantarium, Theodore.\" Canute glanced around
      at the glass walls of the laboratory. \"These walls should be all screen, right?\"\r\nTheodore
      walked directly into the room after hearing Canute's request. After displaying
      the map on the glass, he did not come out, and continued to play with his \"chorus.\"\r\n\"As
      I said, Meialia has the ability to regain most of the land, except for Saint
      Vasolina.\"\r\n\"Is the local garrison strong?\"\r\n\"You should remember,
      there is something in Vasolina.\"\r\n\"The Portal.\"\r\n\"Yes, they have sufficient
      supply lines into the city. This is not a siege, Canute.\"\r\n\"But they keep
      standing there. Are they just there to humiliate Meialians?\"\r\n\"They may
      still be looking for the Avgium.\"\r\n\"Ha! Good luck to them!\" Theodore shouted
      in the room, \"Although I often suspect that this is a fake Avgium, it will
      be the end of the world if they find it. No, then the world will be peaceful,
      as quiet as no one has ever lived before.\"\r\n\"But the important thing is
      that the Meialians had already taken Swisha two or three days ago. They formed
      an agency and established so-called 'Independent Swisha', so we\u2019ll come
      back from the chaos.\"\r\nCanute glanced at the map of Fantarium, roughly out
      of the control area of \u200B\u200BMeialia and the Supreme Council.\r\nThis
      is not the end for him, is it?\r\n"
