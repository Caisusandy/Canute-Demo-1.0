    text: '"Are you back from the underground patrol?"

      "The underground is
      a mess now, sir."

      "How bad, Finn?"

      "Our people in the city
      said they saw the Septian are setting fire to destroy this place, and some
      refugees were ransacking in the fire."

      "It''s similar to the Supreme
      Council''s prediction."

      "I need to prepare to meet the newcomers at
      Snowgate Military Academy recently. We need someone to prepare to form a security
      bureau in Calay and tell Mr. Devin Gallad that I need to meet him."

      "Are
      you going to Meialia?"

      "It can be said. I don''t think I will stand
      on the land of Meialia for a few hours. I should go and return quickly. Anyway,
      why are you interested in Meialia?

      "..."

      "I''m also quite interested,
      Finn. After all, we can see magics there. If possible, I hope I can bring some
      souvenirs back, like some aethium products, what are you interested in?"

      "Uh?"

      "Yeah.
      You''d better go and pass a message to Mr. Gallard first."

      "Emmm, sir."

      "What,
      Finn,"

      "Is the civil war over?"

      "Almost. When that day comes,
      I will no longer work in the army."

      "Sir, are you leaving?"

      "My
      father wanted me to be a politician because he found that my eloquence was
      good, and he thinks I had the mind for that. But I didn''t accept it. After
      all, I was born in the most anxious era of civil war. That era was not like
      when politicians could save the country. We are enemies on all sides except
      for the outside of Fantarium. The country is on the brink of fall. But now
      that the war is over, we also want to do something else."

      "Sir, where
      are we going next."

      "The Supreme Council said that we will be stationed
      here in Calay."

      "Calay?"

      "Yes, Calay. Finn, we are home."
